# Frontend Design & Development Process Guide

This guide provides a suggested approach for utilizing the documents within the `frontend_design` folder to inform the actual UI/UX design and frontend development of the LLM Interviewer Platform.

## 1. Understanding the Big Picture

*   **Start with**: `frontend_design/README.md`
    *   **Purpose**: Get a high-level overview of the frontend architecture, guiding principles, technology stack considerations, and the overall proposed structure. This sets the context for all other documents.

## 2. Empathize with Users: Flows & Roles

*   **Next, review**: `frontend_design/user_flows/`
    *   `common_auth_flow.md`
    *   `candidate_flow.md`
    *   `hr_flow.md`
    *   `admin_flow.md`
    *   **Purpose**: Understand the distinct journeys and key interactions for each user role. This is crucial for designing intuitive and efficient interfaces that meet user needs. These flows map out the "what" and "why" of user actions.

## 3. Visualize the Interface: Wireframes & Mockups

*   **Then, consult**: `frontend_design/wireframes_mockups/`
    *   `README.md` (for an overview of this section)
    *   `common_screens.md`
    *   `candidate_screens.md`
    *   `hr_screens.md`
    *   `admin_screens.md`
    *   **Purpose**: These documents provide textual descriptions of key screens. Use them as a starting point for creating visual wireframes (low-fidelity) and then mockups (high-fidelity).
    *   **Process**:
        1.  For each screen described, sketch out the layout and placement of UI elements.
        2.  Consider the user flow associated with each screen to ensure navigation and interactions are logical.
        3.  Iterate on these visual designs based on feedback and usability considerations.

## 4. Define the Building Blocks: Component Design

*   **Refer to**: `frontend_design/components/`
    *   `README.md` (for component philosophy)
    *   `common_components.md`
    *   `role_specific_components.md`
    *   **Purpose**: Identify reusable UI patterns and define a library of common components (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.). This promotes consistency and speeds up development. The role-specific components will often be compositions of these common ones.
    *   **Process**:
        1.  As you create visual mockups (Step 3), identify recurring UI elements. These are candidates for common components.
        2.  Define the props (inputs) and expected behavior for each common component.
        3.  Plan out larger, feature-specific, or role-specific components by thinking about how they will compose the common components.

## 5. Plan Data Handling: State & API Integration

*   **Review in parallel with UI design**:
    *   `frontend_design/state_management/README.md`
    *   `frontend_design/api_integration/` (and its sub-documents for each service)
    *   **Purpose**:
        *   **State Management**: Decide on a strategy for managing local, feature-specific, and global application state. This will influence how components fetch, store, and share data.
        *   **API Integration**: Understand which backend services and endpoints each frontend feature/screen will interact with. This is critical for planning data fetching, updates, and error handling. The `*_service_integration.md` files map frontend actions to backend API calls.
    *   **Process**:
        1.  For each screen/feature in your wireframes/mockups, identify the data it needs to display and the data it needs to send to the backend.
        2.  Cross-reference with the `api_integration` documents to confirm endpoints, request/response formats.
        3.  Decide where the state derived from these API calls will live (local component state, feature-level state, or global state).

## 6. Establish Visual Language: Styling & Accessibility

*   **Consult throughout the design process**:
    *   `frontend_design/style_guide/README.md`
    *   `frontend_design/accessibility/README.md`
    *   **Purpose**:
        *   **Style Guide**: Define design tokens (colors, typography, spacing) and choose styling technologies to ensure a consistent look and feel.
        *   **Accessibility**: Incorporate accessibility best practices from the outset to ensure the application is usable by everyone.
    *   **Process**:
        1.  Develop a basic style guide or theme early in the visual design phase.
        2.  Apply accessibility principles (semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, color contrast) as you design and build components.

## 7. Iterative Development Cycle

A typical development workflow for a new feature or screen might be:

1.  **Understand User Flow**: What is the user trying to achieve? (Refer to `user_flows/`)
2.  **Visualize UI**: How should it look and feel? (Refer to `wireframes_mockups/`, create actual visuals)
3.  **Identify Components**: What reusable or new components are needed? (Refer to `components/`)
4.  **Plan Data**: What data is needed? How will it be fetched and managed? (Refer to `api_integration/` and `state_management/`)
5.  **Build Components**: Develop the UI components.
6.  **Implement Logic & API Calls**: Connect components to state and backend APIs.
7.  **Style Components**: Apply styles according to the `style_guide/`.
8.  **Ensure Accessibility**: Test for keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, etc. (Refer to `accessibility/`).
9.  **Test**: Unit, integration, and E2E tests.
10. **Iterate**: Based on feedback and testing.

## Conclusion

This set of design documents provides a comprehensive starting point. They are intended to be living documents that may evolve as the project progresses and more detailed requirements or insights emerge. Effective communication between designers, frontend developers, and backend developers, using these documents as a shared reference, will be key to a successful implementation.
