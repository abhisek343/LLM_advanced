# Wireframes & Mockups (Descriptive)

This section provides textual descriptions of the key screens and UI elements for the LLM Interviewer Platform frontend. Since actual image wireframes cannot be generated in this text-based format, these descriptions aim to convey the layout, components, and information hierarchy of each screen.

## Purpose

*   To visualize the user interface for different user roles and flows.
*   To identify necessary UI components and their placement.
*   To understand the data that needs to be displayed and captured on each screen.
*   To serve as a basis for actual UI/UX design and frontend development.

## Format

Each screen description will typically include:

*   **Screen Name/Route**: The conceptual name of the screen and its likely URL path.
*   **User Role(s)**: Which user roles can access this screen.
*   **Objective**: The primary purpose of the screen for the user.
*   **Key UI Elements**: A list and description of major components on the screen (e.g., forms, tables, buttons, navigation elements).
*   **Data Displayed**: Information fetched from the backend and shown to the user.
*   **User Interactions**: Actions the user can take on the screen.
*   **API Connections**: Relevant backend API endpoints this screen would interact with.

## Document Structure

The wireframes are organized by user role and common screens:

*   `common_screens.md`: Describes screens like Login, Registration, and general layout elements (Header, Footer, Navigation).
*   `candidate_screens.md`: Describes screens specific to the Candidate role (Dashboard, Profile, Interview Interface, etc.).
*   `hr_screens.md`: Describes screens specific to the HR role (Dashboard, Candidate Search, Interview Scheduling, etc.).
*   `admin_screens.md`: Describes screens specific to the Admin role (Dashboard, User Management, System Stats, etc.).

These descriptions should be used in conjunction with the User Flow documents to get a complete picture of the user experience.
