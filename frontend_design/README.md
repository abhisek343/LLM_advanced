# Frontend System Design: LLM Interviewer Platform

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the system design for the frontend of the LLM Interviewer Platform. The platform serves three primary user roles: Candidates, HR personnel, and Administrators, each with a distinct set of functionalities and user interfaces.

The frontend will be designed as a modern Single Page Application (SPA) to provide a responsive, interactive, and seamless user experience.

## 2. Guiding Principles

*   **User-Centric Design**: Prioritize ease of use, intuitive navigation, and clear information hierarchy for all user roles.
*   **Component-Based Architecture**: Utilize a modular design with reusable UI components to ensure consistency, maintainability, and scalability.
*   **Responsiveness**: Ensure the application is accessible and functional across various devices and screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
*   **Performance**: Optimize for fast load times and smooth interactions.
*   **Accessibility (A11y)**: Adhere to WCAG guidelines to make the platform usable by people with disabilities.
*   **Security**: Implement best practices for frontend security, especially regarding user authentication, data handling, and API interactions.
*   **Maintainability & Scalability**: Write clean, well-documented code that is easy to understand, modify, and extend.

## 3. Proposed Technology Stack (Considerations)

*   **Framework/Library**: React, Vue.js, or Angular. The choice will depend on team familiarity, ecosystem, and specific project needs. For this design, we'll assume a generic SPA approach, but examples might lean towards React-like concepts.
*   **State Management**:
    *   Context API (for simpler state)
    *   Redux, Zustand, or Pinia (for more complex global state)
*   **Routing**: React Router (for React), Vue Router (for Vue), or Angular Router.
*   **Styling**:
    *   CSS Modules or Styled Components (for component-scoped styles)
    *   Tailwind CSS (for utility-first styling)
    *   A UI component library like Material-UI, Ant Design, or Chakra UI could be considered to speed up development and ensure consistency.
*   **API Communication**: `fetch` API or a library like `axios` for making HTTP requests to the backend microservices.
*   **Build Tool**: Vite or Webpack (often comes with the chosen framework's CLI).
*   **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library/Vue Test Utils, Cypress for E2E testing.

## 4. High-Level Architecture

The frontend will be a client-side application that communicates with the various backend microservices via REST APIs.

*   **Authentication**: A dedicated authentication flow will manage user login, registration, and session management (likely using JWTs stored securely).
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: The UI will dynamically render components and enable/disable functionalities based on the logged-in user's role.
*   **Modular Structure**: Code will be organized by feature, user role, or component type to enhance clarity and maintainability.

## 5. Directory Structure Overview

A proposed high-level directory structure for the frontend codebase (actual structure might vary based on the chosen framework):

```
src/
|-- App.js (or App.vue, App.component.ts) - Main application component
|-- main.js (or index.js) - Entry point
|-- assets/ (Static assets like images, fonts)
|-- components/ (Reusable UI components)
|   |-- common/ (Buttons, Inputs, Modals, etc.)
|   |-- layout/ (Header, Footer, Sidebar, etc.)
|-- contexts/ (or store/ for state management)
|-- features/ (or views/, pages/, modules/)
|   |-- auth/ (Login, Register, ForgotPassword components/views)
|   |-- candidate/ (Dashboard, Profile, Interviews, Messages components/views)
|   |-- hr/ (Dashboard, CandidateSearch, Applications, Messages components/views)
|   |-- admin/ (UserManagement, SystemStats, HRApplications components/views)
|   |-- interview/ (Interview taking interface, Results view components)
|-- hooks/ (Custom React hooks, if applicable)
|-- services/ (API service clients for interacting with backend)
|-- styles/ (Global styles, theme configurations)
|-- utils/ (Utility functions)
|-- router/ (Routing configuration)
```

## 6. Next Steps in Design Documentation

*   Define detailed User Flows for each role.
*   Create descriptive Wireframes/Mockups for key screens.
*   Detail the Component Library.
*   Specify API Integration points for each feature.
*   Elaborate on State Management.

This document serves as the starting point for a more detailed frontend design process.
