# Frontend Accessibility (A11y) Considerations

This document outlines key considerations for ensuring the LLM Interviewer Platform frontend is accessible to users with disabilities, aiming to comply with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA.

## 1. Importance

Accessibility is crucial for:
*   **Inclusivity**: Allowing users of all abilities to access and use the platform.
*   **Legal Compliance**: Meeting legal requirements in many jurisdictions.
*   **User Experience**: Good accessibility practices often lead to better usability for everyone.

## 2. Key Areas of Focus

### 2.1. Semantic HTML
*   Use HTML elements for their intended purpose (e.g., `<nav>`, `<button>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`).
*   Proper heading structure (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) to define page hierarchy.
*   Use lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<dl>`) for list content.
*   Ensure `alt` text for all informative images; decorative images should have empty `alt=""`.

### 2.2. Keyboard Navigation
*   All interactive elements (links, buttons, form fields, custom controls) must be focusable and operable using only a keyboard.
*   Logical focus order: Ensure tab order follows the visual flow of the page.
*   Visible focus indicators: Clearly highlight the element that currently has keyboard focus. Do not remove default browser focus styles without providing a better, equally clear alternative.
*   Custom widgets (e.g., dropdowns, modals, tabs) must manage focus appropriately (e.g., trapping focus within modals).

### 2.3. ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)
*   Use ARIA attributes where semantic HTML is insufficient to convey roles, states, and properties of custom widgets or dynamic content.
    *   Examples: `role`, `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-haspopup`, `aria-selected`, `aria-live` (for live regions).
*   Avoid redundant ARIA if semantic HTML can achieve the same (e.g., don't put `role="button"` on a `<button>` element).

### 2.4. Color Contrast
*   Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and its background (WCAG AA requires 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text).
*   Ensure contrast for UI components and graphical objects.
*   Use tools to check color contrast during design and development.

### 2.5. Forms and Inputs
*   All form inputs must have clear, programmatically associated labels (using `<label for="inputId">`).
*   Provide clear instructions and error messages.
*   Associate error messages with their respective inputs (e.g., using `aria-describedby`).
*   Ensure form validation feedback is accessible.

### 2.6. Responsive Design & Zoom
*   Content should reflow and be readable when zoomed up to 200% without loss of information or functionality.
*   Ensure usability on various screen sizes and orientations.

### 2.7. Dynamic Content & Updates
*   Use ARIA live regions (`aria-live`, `aria-relevant`, `aria-atomic`) to announce dynamic content changes (e.g., new messages, search results loading, error alerts) to assistive technologies.

### 2.8. Multimedia
*   **Video**: Provide captions and transcripts for pre-recorded video content (e.g., candidate video responses, instructional videos). Consider audio descriptions for visual information.
*   **Audio**: Provide transcripts for audio-only content.

### 2.9. Readability
*   Choose clear, legible fonts.
*   Ensure adequate line spacing and text size.
*   Avoid long lines of text.

## 3. Testing & Tools

*   **Manual Keyboard Testing**: Navigate the entire application using only the keyboard.
*   **Screen Reader Testing**: Test with common screen readers (e.g., NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver).
*   **Automated Accessibility Checkers**: Use browser extensions (e.g., Axe DevTools, WAVE) and build tools (e.g., `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` for React, Pa11y) to catch common issues.
*   **Color Contrast Analyzers**: Tools to check color combinations.
*   **User Testing**: Involve users with disabilities in testing if possible.

## 4. Development Practices

*   Integrate accessibility considerations from the start of the design and development process.
*   Educate the development team on accessibility best practices.
*   Include accessibility checks in code reviews and QA processes.
*   Use UI component libraries that prioritize accessibility or ensure custom components are built accessibly.

By focusing on these areas, the LLM Interviewer Platform can provide an inclusive experience for all users.
